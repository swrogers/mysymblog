My Symblog Repository
=====================

This will be used to hold my work through of the [Symblog Tutorial] [1]

h3: Differences between my version and the symblog version

* I will be using annotations
* Updated to use flashBag instead of setFlash
* Moved "About" and "Contact" into their own "/page" uri
* The Doctrine Migrations Bundle is in its own namespace now, and not under Symfony
* {% render %} has changed to {{ render }}
